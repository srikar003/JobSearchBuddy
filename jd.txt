Where you'll make an impact:

Build and ship features end-to-end, working across React, Node.js and Golang. 
Develop user-facing workflows including data collection forms, reporting interfaces, and account management experiences that handle complex financial data. 
Implement backend APIs and services that power our data syncing and orchestration capabilities, ensuring reliable data flow across systems. 
Write well-tested, maintainable code and participate in code reviews, contributing to the team's technical quality and standards. 
Collaborate with Product, Design, and other engineers to break down requirements, identify technical approaches, and deliver solutions efficiently. 
Debug and resolve production issues across the stack, ensuring system reliability for our customers. 

Requirements:

4-6 years of fullstack engineering experience with exposure to both frontend and backend development. 
Solid fundamentals in web development, including JavaScript/TypeScript, modern frontend frameworks (React preferred), API design, and working with databases. 
Comfortable working across the full stack - you may have a preference but can contribute effectively on both frontend and backend work. 
Collaborative mindset and strong communication skills - you work effectively with teammates and ask good questions when you need clarity. 
Eager to learn and grow your technical skills - you're curious about new technologies and open to feedback. 
Self-directed and capable of owning features with minimal oversight, while knowing when to ask for input or guidance. 
Bias toward shipping and iteration - you balance getting things done with building things well. 

You'll stand out if you have:

Experience building B2B SaaS products or working in fintech/financial services. 
Exposure to building integrations, working with third-party APIs, or data transformation pipelines. 
Background at startups where you had to wear multiple hats and ship features independently. 
Experience with testing frameworks and writing automated tests for both frontend and backend code. 
Interest in using AI tools to improve your development workflow and productivity.
